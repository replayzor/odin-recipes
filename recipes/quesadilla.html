	<h2>Description</h2>
	<hr />
	<p>
		A quesadilla is a Mexican dish that dates back to the 16th century.
		Traditional quesadillas were made with a corn tortilla that was warmed on a
		griddle, filled with cheese and various other fillings (meat, vegetables),
		and then folded over to be eaten by hand.
	</p>
	<p>
		The addition of toppings like guacamole, salsa, and sour cream seems to have
		come along later. And, as Americans have adopted quesadillas, they've put
		their own spin on them, adding untraditional fillings such as scrambled eggs
		to make breakfast quesadillas and often swapping out flour tortillas for the
		corn tortillas.

		<li>
			Heat the tortillas until air pockets form: Heat a large skillet (cast iron
			works great) on medium high heat. Add a small amount of oil (about 1/2
			teaspoon) and spread it around the bottom of the pan with a spatula (you
			could use butter as well). Take one large flour tortilla and place it in
			the pan. Flip the tortilla over a few times, 10 seconds between flips. Air
			pockets should begin to form within the tortilla.

		</li>
		<li>
			Add the cheese and other ingredients: When pockets of air begin to form,
			take a handful of grated cheese, sprinkle over the top of the tortilla,
			making sure that the cheese does not land on the pan itself. Add whatever
			additional ingredients you choose - green onion, sliced mushrooms, olives,
			tomatoes, etc. If you would like your quesadilla to be a chicken
			quesadilla, add some diced cooked chicken. Take care not to layer on the
			ingredients too thickly - this is a quesadilla, not a quiche!

		</li>
		<li>
			Lower the heat and cover pan: Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan.
			The pan should be hot enough by now to have plenty of residual heat to
			melt the cheese and brown the tortilla. If the quesadilla begins to smoke
			too much, remove from the heat. After a minute, check to see if the cheese
			is melted. If not, return the cover and keep checking every minute until
			the cheese is melted.

		</li>
		<li>
			Fold the tortilla over: When the cheese is sufficiently melted, use a
			spatula to lift up one side of the quesadilla and flip over the other
			side, as if you were making an omelette. The tortilla should by now be
			browned slightly. If it is not browned, turn the heat up to high and flip
			the quesadilla over every 10 seconds or so until it gets browned.

		<li>
			Remove quesadilla from pan and cut into wedges: To make the lettuce to
			accompany the quesadilla, thinly slice some iceberg lettuce. Sprinkle some
			cider vinegar on it and some salt. Serve with the lettuce, salsa, sour
			cream, and guacamole.
